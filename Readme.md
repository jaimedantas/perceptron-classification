# Implementation the perceptron algorithm in MATLAB
The perceptron algorithm is used for linear classification in machine learning.

### Features
- Perceptron implementation on MATLAB
- Logistic loss analysis
- Hinge loss analysis
- Binary loss analysis

### Dataset
An 3-dimensional dataset with 200 data points is used for classification. This dataset was originally proposed by Dr. [Ruth Urner](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~ruth/) on one of her assignments for ML.
